			"Welcome to my portfolio website! I'm thrilled to share my passion for programming, mathematics, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), and photography with you. My name is Tom Shabalin, and I'm currently in my 3rd year as a Computer Science student at Ariel University. Beside my studies, I am working as a Software Engineer at AST SpaceMobile, where I have the incredible opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge projects in the space technology industry. In addition to my work in industry, I am a part-time lecturer at Ariel University. Sharing knowledge and guiding aspiring developers is something that brings me immense satisfaction.  Deep learning is another field that excites me. The ability of algorithms to learn and adapt from vast amounts of data is astonishing.  Thank you for stopping by my portfolio website. I invite you to browse through my projects and explore the solutions I've crafted throughout my career. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, I would be thrilled to connect. Let's create something remarkable together!",
